# Flashcard Generator 
Welcome ðŸŒŸ

Hello, this repository houses my code for the Flashcard Generator App. This app was made as part of my Almabetter course, for my Frontend Capstone Project. 

This website can be used to create decks of Flashcards grouped by name, image, and description for each group. Each group can have as many terms with their definitions and images as the user wants. You can view all the groups in one place. See any terms belonging to a particular flashcard and/or delete them.
